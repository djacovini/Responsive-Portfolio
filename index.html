            <p>David is a battle-tested entrepreneur with strong background in finance and business development.</p>
            <p>Most recently David had served as the Founder and President of Innovator Management LLC and the President, Treasurer, and a Trustee of the Academy Funds Trust.  There he built a boutique investment product provider designing and launching leading-edge mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.  In 2017 the Innovator business was sold to Innovator Capital Management, LLC.</p>
            <p>David’s varied finance career is a testament to his analytical ability and prudent judgment. His Wall Street career included trading interest rate products, running a strategy group, and structuring and marketing derivatives ranging from vanilla products to complex exotic structures.</p>
            <p>David’s financial practice is rooted in the theoretical understanding he developed in his academic studies.  He earned his Master of Business Administration from the MIT Sloan School of Management with a concentration in Financial Engineering in 2002 and his Bachelor of Arts from the College of the Holy Cross in 1997.</p>
